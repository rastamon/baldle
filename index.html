                <h1>James Baldwin</h1>
                <p>Some view him as a prophet
preaching love and salvation, while others as a seer
forecasting death and destruction. Some people see him
as a civil-rights advocate writing protest literature, and
others view him as an artist imaginatively portraying the
plight of the black American or the alienated man.
Undoubtedly, James Baldwin was an essayist, a novelist,
and a civil rights activist.

            <h1>About the Author</h1>
            <p class="text-left">James Baldwin — grandson of a slave — was born in Harlem in 1924; he was the oldest of
                nine children. At age fourteen, he began
                to work as a preacher. By delivering sermons, he developed his voice as a writer, but also grew
                conflicted about the Church's stance on racial inequality and homosexuality. After high school, he began
                writing novels and essays while taking a series of odd jobs. But the issues that had driven him away
                from the Church were still inescapable in his daily life.
            </p>
            <p class="text-left">Baldwin like Malcolm X and Martin Luther King, was a prominent intellect and staunch
                opponent of Jim Crow during the Civil Rights movement. He frequently debated white and black scholars
                from across the country. In February of 1965, he engaged in his most salient and notable discourse with
                William F. Buckley Jr—a debate that was aptly named: “Baldwin vs. Buckley.” The televised gained
                national attention and the two men confronted each other on the socio-political climate of the country,
                with Baldwin emerging victorious in the debate

        <div class="theme-info spacing text-left">
            <p>While the plot of each novel is unique, they have many themes in common, especially racism,
                classism, white privilege, homosexuality, bisexuality, nationalism, fundamental Christianity,
                and social alienation.
            </p>
            <p>
                In “Sonny’s Blues” and “Previous Condition”, James Baldwin illuminates themes of loneliness and
                isolation in the pursuit of finding a space that feels like home. Baldwin’s creative style in both
                stories effectively gives his audience perspective and insight into these themes, permitting a
                deeper comprehension of how they relate to the world outside of his stories.
                In “Come Out the Wilderness,” Baldwin uses the themes of spirituality, sexuality, and morality
                to unmask the heartbreak of an African American woman and her ultimate futile struggle for
                control of her future and her happiness in mid-century New York
            </p>
            <p>
                The consistent themes in Baldwin’s fiction, including personal identity, racial struggle, and the
                role of religion in daily life are present in each work. . The ever-so-ubiquitous theme of racism
                and subsequent racial segregation and class supremacy is the greatest socio-cultural theme
                within the work.
